How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Was much faster than comparing line by line.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It will give me the opportunity to check my progress.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

manual commits allow the opportunity to decide the right time.  Automatic commits ensure they happen and avoid lost work.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I believe it is based on different ideas on priorities.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Can see the changes in the different versions.
